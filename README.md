##Hi, I’m Dillon Noronha 👋
I build secure, observable systems and high-polish UIs—from low-level C (virtual machines) to Python backends (FastAPI/Redis/Postgres) to React/Tailwind frontends. Sometimes I ship 3D/real-time projects in Unreal Engine 5 for fun and learning.

🧠 How I like to code
Security first: encryption, access control, SSH hardening, least privilege, clear runbooks.

Keep it simple: small, well-named modules with clean interfaces > cleverness.

Observability from day one: logs/metrics/traces (OpenTelemetry + Grafana) to make issues measurable.

Automate the boring stuff: Dockerized dev, reproducible scripts, GitHub Actions CI/CD.

Performance with a purpose: budget for p95, load test, and remove bottlenecks early.

Readable > merely working: comments, examples, and docs for future-me (and teammates).

philosophy: security ∧ simplicity ∧ observability
process:   design → build → measure → iterate → document

🧩 Projects I’m proud of
VirtuOrchid — distributed job orchestrator (Python/FastAPI, Docker, Redis, Postgres) with autoscaling workers, RBAC, WebSocket log streaming, CI/CD, and end-to-end telemetry. Sustained ~1k concurrent jobs with p95 < 150ms.

VirtuMachi — a virtual machine in C with a custom ISA, registers/stack, and a fetch-decode-execute cycle that runs bytecode (e.g., Fibonacci).

Secure Anonymous Communication System — privacy-centric messaging with end-to-end encryption, granular access control, and anonymous identity management.

VirtuStyle — interactive character-customization in Unreal Engine 5, integrated with a responsive web frontend (HTML/CSS/JS).

VirtuWeather — React + Tailwind SPA using OpenWeatherMap, resilient data-loading patterns, and reusable components.

Crossy Road (UE5) — modern remake with custom Blender assets, Lumen lighting, Chaos physics, and C++ gameplay systems.

Want links? I’ll add repository URLs or demos on request.
